--To fix/add--

-Random death chance
--Capsules eat cubes and die

-Sphere AI
--Spheres go to the old position of Capsules, fixing it causes Capsules to constantly change targets

-More species
--With the modularization, it wouldn't be terribly hard to create more species, I'd just have to balance it again

-Random stat variations
--Not too important, but it'd add some spicy variation to everything. Stats as in hunger, maxreproduction, colour, size, speed(?), etc

-Camera movement
--This would allow for larger maps and/or zooming in

-Hover UI
--Hover over an object to see its stats

-Better map
--More than just a square, possibly with colours and variations(maybe even biomes or even procedurally generated)

-Menu/UI
--A main menu would be nice, as well as some options to pause/play, speed up/down, etc
--Add UI elements that change things like mobcap
--Main Menu created with options to play and quit

-Animal Configuration
--In between Main Menu and the Simulation, add a scene that allows for the configuration of Cube and Capsule variables
--This would allow the simulation to be editable and have control variables to see what each variable's effect is


--If really bored--

-Weather
--And, obviously, make it affect the plants and animals

-Water
--Realistically, animals don't just require food, they also require a source of water. Adding one would add realism and limitations

-Disease
--Randomly infect certain animals with disease


--Fixed/Added--

-Capsules constantly changing targets as they move
--They need to pick a target, go to it, then set a new target
--They seem to do this now

-Capsule swarms
--Capsules target the same object, so they end up moving in a large swarm. Make them more individualistic
--While still moving in large groups, they have more individualism and don't target the same object

-Plant and Animal caps
--Imposing a cap would mean an unnecessarily large number of plants or animals aren't produced, allowing the simulation to run faster
--It isn't perfect, but it does work(They can go over the cap, but can't reproduce after that)

-Balance Ecosystem
--The ecosystem either quickly dies or grows too rapidly; seek a balance of sustainability
--Imposing the mob cap now allows for sustainability

-Cubes grow out of bounds
--With the new system, cubes have no limit on how far they can grow, meaning they can grow further than the walls
--I just removed the old system of growing near each other, and made them grow randomly anywhere in the map

-Cubes spawn and die at once
--Cubes spawn and die in very similar time periods, giving the effect of something akin to a heartbeat
--Technically not fixed, the mob cap makes it worse. I don't think this is fixable
